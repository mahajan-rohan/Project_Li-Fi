# 🚀 Project: Li-Fi (Optical Communication using IR rays) 🔦

### I've been working on Data Transfer Through Light for the past few days and have been very eager to learn about Arduino boards and programming them. This project is based on transferring data through IR rays, achieved by using binary bits 0️⃣ and 1️⃣.

## 🛠 Working
### The text from the transmitter is encoded into binary bits (0️⃣ and 1️⃣) and sent through the IR transmitter towards the IR receiver. Here, the decoding algorithm converts those binary bits back into the original text.

## I learned the following while building this project:

### 🖥️ Arduino Boards
### 💻 Arduino Programming Language
### 💡 Working of LED
### 📡 Working of IR Transmitter
### 📷 Working of Photodiode
### 🌞 Working of LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)
### 🔢 Text to Binary Conversion and many more...

## 📑 Paper Published in International Research Journal of Modernization in Engineering Technology and Science (IRJMETS)📜🏅🎓✅
